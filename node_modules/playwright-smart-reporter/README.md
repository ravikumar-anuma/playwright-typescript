- **Per-Test History Dots** - Click dots to see individual test results from previous runs
- **Global Historical State** - Navigate between tests while maintaining historical context

### Attention-Based Filtering

- **Visual Badges** - Tests display NEW FAILURE, REGRESSION, or FIXED badges
- **Filter Chips** - Quick filters for attention-requiring tests
- **Smart Sorting** - Tests needing attention automatically sorted to top

### Enhanced Failure Clusters

## Report Views

### Overview

The Overview provides a quick summary of your test suite health:

- **Pass Rate Ring** - Visual indicator with percentage
- **Suite Health Grade** - Combined score (A+ to F) based on pass rate, stability, and performance
- **Stat Cards** - Pass/fail/skip/flaky counts with colored indicators
- **Attention Required** - Cards highlighting flaky tests and fixed tests
- **Failure Clusters** - Grouped errors with previews and affected test counts
- **Quick Insights** - Slowest test, most flaky test, test distribution

### Tests

Browse and filter all tests with powerful filtering options:

- **Status Filters** - All, Passed, Failed, Skipped
- **Health Filters** - Flaky, Slow, New
- **Grade Filters** - Filter by stability grade (A, B, C, D, F)
- **Attention Filters** - New Failures, Regressions, Fixed
- **Suite Filters** - Filter by test suite (from `test.describe()` blocks)
- **Tag Filters** - Filter by tags (from annotations like `@smoke`, `@critical`)
- **Search** - Find tests by name

Each test card shows:
- Status indicator and test name
- Suite badge and tags (if applicable)
- Duration and stability grade
- Flakiness indicator and performance trend
- History dots (clickable for historical view)
- Expandable details with steps, errors, screenshots, and AI suggestions

### Trends

Interactive charts showing test suite trends over time:

- **Pass Rate** - Track pass rate improvements or regressions
- **Duration** - Monitor test suite execution time
- **Flaky Tests** - See flakiness trends across runs
- **Slow Tests** - Track performance issues over time

Click any chart bar to view that historical run's data.

### Comparison

Compare current run against a baseline:

- Pass rate change with trend indicator
- Duration change
- Test count differences
- Flaky test count changes

### Gallery

Visual grid of all test attachments:

- Screenshots with thumbnail previews
- Video recordings
- Trace files with direct viewer access
- Filter by test status

## Flakiness Indicators

- 🟢 **Stable** (<10% failure rate)
- 🟡 **Unstable** (10-30% failure rate)
- 🔴 **Flaky** (>30% failure rate)
- ⚪ **New** (no history yet)
- ⚪ **Skipped** (test was skipped)

## Stability Grades

- **A+ (95-100)**: Rock solid, consistently passing
- **A (90-94)**: Very stable with rare failures
- **B (80-89)**: Generally stable with occasional issues
- **C (70-79)**: Moderately stable, needs attention
- **D (60-69)**: Unstable, frequent failures
- **F (<60)**: Critically unstable, requires immediate attention

## Performance Trends

- ↑ **Regression** - Test is slower than average
- ↓ **Improved** - Test is faster than average
- → **Stable** - Test is within normal range

## Trace Viewer

The report includes **Download Trace** and **View Trace** actions on failed tests.

To open a trace directly in Playwright's Trace Viewer:

```bash
npx playwright-smart-reporter-view-trace ./traces/<trace>.zip
```

## Network Logs

Network requests are automatically extracted from Playwright trace files - no code changes required. Each test displays an expandable "Network Logs" section showing:

- **Method & URL** - HTTP method and request URL
- **Status Code** - Response status with color coding (green for 2xx, yellow for 3xx, red for 4xx/5xx)
- **Duration** - Request timing with visual waterfall
- **Size** - Request and response payload sizes

Expand individual entries to see:
- Request/response headers
- Request body (for POST/PUT/PATCH requests)
- Detailed timing breakdown (DNS, connect, SSL, wait, receive)

### Configuration

```typescript
reporter: [
  ['playwright-smart-reporter', {
    // Network logging is enabled by default
    enableNetworkLogs: true,

    // Exclude static assets (images, fonts, CSS, JS) - default: true
    networkLogExcludeAssets: false,  // Set to false to show all requests

    // Maximum entries per test - default: 50
    networkLogMaxEntries: 30,
  }],
]
```

### Requirements

Network logs require trace files to be available. Ensure your Playwright config enables tracing:

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
use: {
  trace: 'retain-on-failure',  // or 'on' to always capture
}
```

## CI Integration

### Persisting History Across Runs

For flakiness detection and performance trends to work in CI, persist `test-history.json` between runs.

#### GitHub Actions

```yaml
- name: Restore test history
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: test-history.json
    key: test-history-${{ github.ref }}
    restore-keys: |
      test-history-

- name: Run Playwright tests
  run: npx playwright test

- name: Save test history
  uses: actions/cache/save@v4
  if: always()
  with:
    path: test-history.json
    key: test-history-${{ github.ref }}-${{ github.run_id }}
```

#### GitLab CI

```yaml
test:
  cache:
    key: test-history-$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG
    paths:
      - test-history.json
    policy: pull-push
  script:
    - npx playwright test
```

#### CircleCI

```yaml
- restore_cache:
    keys:
      - test-history-{{ .Branch }}
      - test-history-

- run: npx playwright test

- save_cache:
    key: test-history-{{ .Branch }}-{{ .Revision }}
    paths:
      - test-history.json
```

### CI Environment Detection

The reporter automatically detects CI environments and enriches history with:
- **Run ID** - Unique identifier for the run
- **Branch** - Current branch name
- **Commit** - Short commit SHA
- **CI Provider** - GitHub, GitLab, CircleCI, Jenkins, Azure DevOps

### Webhook Notifications

Configure Slack or Teams webhooks to receive notifications when tests fail:

```typescript
reporter: [
  ['playwright-smart-reporter', {
    slackWebhook: process.env.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL,
    teamsWebhook: process.env.TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL,
  }],
]
```

### Merging Reports from Multiple Machines

When running tests in parallel across multiple machines (sharding), merge both test results and history files.

#### 1. Configure each machine

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
const outputDir = process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_BLOB_OUTPUT_DIR || 'blob-report';

export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [
    ['blob'],
    ['playwright-smart-reporter', {
      outputFile: `${outputDir}/smart-report.html`,
      historyFile: `${outputDir}/test-history.json`,
    }],
  ],
});
```

#### 2. Run tests on each machine

```bash
# Machine 1
PLAYWRIGHT_BLOB_OUTPUT_DIR=blob-reports/machine1 npx playwright test --shard=1/2

# Machine 2
PLAYWRIGHT_BLOB_OUTPUT_DIR=blob-reports/machine2 npx playwright test --shard=2/2
```

#### 3. Merge history files

```bash
npx playwright-smart-reporter-merge-history \
  blob-reports/machine1/test-history.json \
  blob-reports/machine2/test-history.json \
  -o blob-reports/merged/test-history.json
```

#### 4. Merge blob reports

```bash
cp blob-reports/machine1/*.zip blob-reports/machine2/*.zip blob-reports/merged/
npx playwright merge-reports --reporter=playwright-smart-reporter blob-reports/merged
```

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
